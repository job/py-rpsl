A Python implementation to parse some RPSL attributes.

Only RPSL-VIA attribute support
===============================

This library serves as a proof of concept for the
[draft-ietf-grow-rpsl-via](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-grow-rpsl-via)
draft. It is possible that over time more the parsing of more attributes will be implemented.
